# Introduction to Pandas, May 2018 Edition

Pandas is a Python package for visualising, cleaning and analysing spreadsheet-type data inside the programming language Python. It should be noted that Pandas is a massive library, with a whole range of functions and functionality - it's impossible to cover all of the topics that you would find useful. However, this training will aim to introduce you to key concepts, and to give you the knowledge required to seek out the answers you need when you're trying to find something new.  

This Pandas workshop will be running from **1pm - 5pm on Tuesday 15th May**, at the CoLab training space, also known as __Room 329, Level 3, Eastern Resource Centre, Building 171__. 

There are currently a number of contruction works going on around the ERC however, and accessibility is limited. For an animated version of how to get into our space, follow our (sometimes) resident ResDog Snickers!

This workshop is designed for those trying to explore and learn about the Python package Pandas for the first time. The content is suitable for a range of learners, though users will preferably already have some familiarity with Python. 

This workshop will be using Python 3.6 inside the Jupyter Notebook. You can find installation instructions inside the 
[Python_Installation.md](https://github.com/resbaz/Sept2017_PandasWorkshop/blob/master/Python_installation.md)
instruction file. 

While we will be learning in the Jupyter environment, you may find this a bit heavy for your day-to-day coding life. 
There are a number of light-weight text editors and Integrative Development Environments (IDEs - this means you can write and 
run your code in the same program) freely available on the internet.

IDEs:
- Spyder. This comes installed with the Anaconda package, and you should be able to find it in your system's programs list after installation
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This one has a free community-edition license, but anybody working on research which could be patented, beware! The pycharm owners dislike the free version being used on for-profit projects, and the licensing reflects this.

Text Editors:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/). Free. No ads. Allows Git/Github integration.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Unlimited free license. Occasional pop-up ads. Slightly easier to use.

You will also find that the content for the workshop is available in both the markdown (\*.md) format, for online viewing, and as an iPython notebook (\*.ipynb), which will contain useable code fragments, challenges and explanations for the workshop content.
